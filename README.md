# CourseraCleaningData
Repo for Assignment on Coursera Cleaning Data Course

### To read result dataset
    data <- read.table("ActivitySubjectAvg.txt", header = TRUE) 
    View(data)

### State of purposes
This is assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera. The aim of analysis is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Source files
Source files are part of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (full description is provided at the last part of this readme file). Source files, that were used for this analysis are:
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* test
  * X_test.txt
  * y_test.txt
  * subject_test.txt
* train
  * X_train.txt
  * y_train.txt
  * subject_train.txt
  
### Analysis Description
1. We use dplyr-library.
2. First of all we read features from features.txt and subset those, which ends with "mean()" or "std()" (values like mean-X we  suppose to be a raw data and are not going to output).
3. We clean Feature names: gettibg (for example) "tBodyGyroMagStd" instead of "tBodyGyroMag-std()".
4. We read train data sets (X_train, y_train and subject_train) and concatanate them (as columns) together.
5. We read test data sets (X_test, y_test and subhject_test) and concatanate them (as columns) together.
6. We create fullSet, which contains rows from train and test sets.
7. We subset only features we are interested in (from 2.)
8. We set tidy ColumnNames and replace Activity Id with Activity Names.
9. We create Result Tidy Dataset with mean of all variables for each Subject and Activity Name.
10. We write result dataset to file "ActivitySubjectAvg.txt". 

### Result Dataset
Resulting Data Set is **activitySubjectAvgSet**, full decription can be found in CodeBook.md file.
To read file run
    data <- read.table("ActivitySubjectAvg.txt", header = TRUE)

Here are the data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

### Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
